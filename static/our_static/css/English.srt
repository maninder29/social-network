1
00:00:03,652 --> 00:00:07,923
2 gunman have been shot dead after
a firing in a shopping center in england.

2
00:00:07,956 --> 00:00:11,919
As many as 80,000 residence of the city have
fled their homes to escape the shooting at...

3
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:15,663
Government forces in the Southern philippine
have launch an offense against the rebels

4
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:19,352
since fighting escalates in this
part of Asia's largest catholic country.

5
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:25,026
A national day of mourning in the philippine,
after 44 police commandos were killed

6
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,307
in the line of duty when an
anti-terror operation went wrong.

7
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:33,054
200 heavily armed separatists from the
national liberation front attacked the city...

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,349
The officers from the police special action force
were killed during an operation

9
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,938
to capture one of the
most wanted terrorist...

10
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:43,903
Punjab province
50 miles north of Lahore, Pakistan

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,289
philippine authorities now say
the toll in yesterday's hotel bombing

12
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:13,474
has risen to 146 dead
and 231 wounded.

13
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:17,534
It is the most devastating terrorist
attack in Asia, in 10 years.

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,095
And the worst ever, in Manila.

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,535
While no organization has taken
responsibility for the blast,

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,410
western intelligence sources have identified

17
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:33,202
chemical traces that are the hallmark of
the infamous arms-dealer, aarmir barkawi

18
00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:37,533
international security experts say
that the barkawi family

19
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:40,408
is now instigating violence
in remote capitals

20
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:47,748
to foster instability, and thus fuel
massive arms sales around the globe.

21
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,540
There he is.
Kamran.

22
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,191
Raza.

23
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:29,414
Did philippine intelligence track you?

24
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,475
Father,

25
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:45,199
- you did well,
- thank you.

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,555
We need to discuss major general rahmad.

27
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,030
It's your sister's wedding.

28
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:54,002
I'm sorry, this can't wait.

29
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,689
I think your isi officer was compromised.

30
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,285
Kamran,

31
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,949
all Pakistani intelligence
officers are compromised.

32
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,099
One of our afghani friends discovered
a German bnd agent in his circle.

33
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,712
And?

34
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,307
That particular general won't be
very useful to us anymore.

35
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,209
He's been eliminated.

36
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,799
Thought you might want to know.

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,808
Don't forget his family.

38
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:33,003
Vengeance must always be profound,
and absolute.

39
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,219
Very happy.

40
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,947
"Barkawi on site"

41
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:50,752
creech air force base,
Nevada

42
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:54,546
Pentagon just received target
confirmation from mi-6 ground missile.

43
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,537
You're free to execute.

44
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Hell of a a presidential race, sir

45
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,230
everyday is the same damn joke.

46
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,660
Seriously?

47
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,083
What the hell are
you made out of?

48
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:54,354
Bourbon and poor choices.

49
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,880
You pick a name yet?

50
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,212
Well, we were thinking Benjamin
if it was a boy.

51
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,978
- Really?
- Hell, no!!

52
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:08,607
- Ha ha ha!
- If it's a girl, maybe.

53
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,150
Voight.

54
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:19,254
You want to run
him over for me?

55
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,307
Believe me, sir.
We tried.

56
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,910
Baby.

57
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,290
Babe.

58
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,871
What?

59
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,589
A little problem in the nursery.

60
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,659
Alright, so 6 cameras, right?

61
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,989
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

62
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,159
- Why is that too much?
- Yeah, maybe.

63
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,489
Yeah, it's too much.
And I thought that.

64
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,714
They're baby gifts from the guys.

65
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,689
- I'll take them down.
- All we need,

66
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,569
- is one baby monitor.
- One baby monitor, right.

67
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,769
Okay,

68
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,480
- and a kevlar mattress.
- And a kevlar mattress.

69
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,800
Come here,

70
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,069
- unhand me.
- Never.

71
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,539
And guess who just
got the next week off.

72
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,049
Oh, don't toy with me, young man,
cause there will be consequences.

73
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,870
We're finishing this nursery.
I can't believe it's taking me this long.

74
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,439
Paint samples.

75
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,901
- What?
- Yeah.

76
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,309
Oh, I got to show you
these amazing paint samples.

77
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:46,350
- Can I get a shower first?
- Not yet.

78
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:05,919
Re: Resignation

79
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,977
dear sir
i regret to inform you that

80
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:12,013
I hereby tender my resignation

81
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:17,115
from the United States security service
presidential protection division.

82
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:23,290
It has been an honor

83
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:31,539
and a privilege.

84
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,259
Sir, speaker of the house is waiting,

85
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,462
and the senate majority leader
would like five of your time.

86
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:52,340
Ahh, hmm,
I'll take him first.

87
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,849
When is trumbull getting back?

88
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,318
The vice-president has
3 more days of vacation

89
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,229
and insinuated considerable violence
if he heard my voice before then.

90
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,849
Never get between
that man and a fish.

91
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:07,430
- Sir, I got your son on video-chat.
- Excellent.

92
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:10,045
- He had his first date last night.
- Mr. president,

93
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,819
you need to take this, sir.

94
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,158
Sir, speaker of the house?

95
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:16,823
You need to take this now, sir.

96
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:23,779
This is the president.

97
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,350
Okay, thank you.

98
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,299
Sources confirmed that
prime minister James Wilson

99
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,278
has died while sleeping in his
residence at 10 downey street.

100
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,436
He is believed to have
suffered a heart attack.

101
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:53,599
Possibly, from complications
after the surgical procedure

102
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,819
to repair his knee a day earlier.

103
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,889
An autopsy has been scheduled
within the next 48 hours.

104
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,824
To determine the actual cause of death.

105
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:02,861
It's the white house.

106
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,853
It's okay.
My mom can come over.

107
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:17,166
London

108
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:27,001
70 whitehall
the cabinet office

109
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:30,078
what we are proposing is that the
funeral takes place this Thursday,

110
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:34,191
this Thursday, the 9th,
4:00 pm, at St. Paul's.

111
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,658
The confirm attendees are all world leaders,

112
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,655
with the lone exception
of the Russian president,

113
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,653
well, no love lost there.

114
00:10:41,678 --> 00:10:46,616
Our royal family will attend the private
services in St. James's palace the morning of

115
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:50,562
with 28 other heads of state
from all over the globe.

116
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:53,323
As per foreign royals.
Prince Albert of Monaco,

117
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:56,784
queen rania of Jordan,
Saudi prince muqrin,

118
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,544
yes, it's a logistical nightmare.

119
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:02,780
But let's make sure this runs
without a hitch.

120
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:04,895
Questions?

121
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:08,975
And what special requests did
the yank circus demand so far?

122
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,614
Dallas cowboys cheerleaders,
part of the ratherly possibly?

123
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,475
That's a request I can live with.

124
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,446
I'm partial to the Kardashians, myself.
As apparently as her majesty.

125
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,039
19 special requests from
12 different countries.

126
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,785
We denied all of them.

127
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,899
Any issues or special concern
with our current assessment?

128
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,869
We all know about he 350
or so British nationals who

129
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,788
traveled back and forth
to Syria in the past year,

130
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:39,745
as we've seen before in Iraq,
and Afghanistan.

131
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,833
Our rising concern is the handful
we believe to be former military.

132
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:46,940
- Is any of this actionable?
- No.

133
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,975
Very well.

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,762
And we will certify
our dear friend James,

135
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,717
with dignity.

136
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,953
Give him a ceremony he deserves.

137
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,150
Sir.

138
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,190
- Are you ready for us?
- Yeah, come on in.

139
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,620
Take a seat.

140
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,256
What are you guys
so damn nervous about?

141
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:21,245
The brits are world-class.
We all know their reputation.

142
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,955
But still,
these are the trips I hate.

143
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,319
Last minute, out of the country,
no time to plan.

144
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,405
Are you sure I can't
talk you out of this?

145
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,420
Lynn, it's a state funeral.

146
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,739
They're our oldest, strongest ally.

147
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,295
Alright. I spent half the night
on the line with our advance team.

148
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,420
Metropolitan police will secure the parameter
of the funeral at St. Paul's cathedral.

149
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:45,085
Air force one will land
at stansted airport.

150
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,133
On the ground,
it's all Mike.

151
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,342
Touch down.

152
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,090
Then a 12-minute chopper
ride to somerset house.

153
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,566
From there we take
an armored vehicle escort

154
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:58,794
down sweet street,
to the cathedral.

155
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,369
You don't seem thrilled.

156
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,270
The British have their hands full.

157
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:05,482
It's a cluster-fuck.

158
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:06,779
Sir.

159
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:08,166
Well,

160
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,999
40 different countries,
with 40 different security teams.

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,149
Minimal flexibility on approach routes,
funeral seating, egress.

162
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,673
- Can we make it work?
- Mike?

163
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,189
I always do, sir.

164
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,590
Good.

165
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,050
I know it's not great timing
for you, but...

166
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,760
It's what I do.

167
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,718
Thank you sir.

168
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:47,083
Vice president
Allan trumbull

169
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:50,225
- there's my man.
- Mr. vice-president,

170
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,005
- how was your vacation, sir?
- Son.

171
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,479
Do you have any idea,
the joy a man feels

172
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,369
pulling a 70 pound king mackerel
out of the waters around Jekyll island?

173
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,325
- No, sir, I don't.
- That makes two of us.

174
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,798
And I have to wait until
next year to find out.

175
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,659
But,
thanks for asking.

176
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:20,975
Oh, yeah, that's in sinai.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,233
- It's beautiful.
- There you go.

178
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:27,100
Jeez, it's incredible.
I love these things, they...

179
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,370
Don't worry about a thing,
we'll be fine.

180
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,703
- Doris, can we have a minute?
- Sure.

181
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,574
- Oh you meant Leah. Right.
- Very funny, Doris.

182
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,840
She tells me not to worry.

183
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:52,183
It's only 3 days.

184
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,611
- Yeah,
- and I'm not due for 2 weeks.

185
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,259
I'm not walking away,
quite so easy this time.

186
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,966
Hey.

187
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,930
I got this.

188
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,278
You go and you do what
you have to do, and

189
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:11,135
we will be right here
when you get back.

190
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,615
Okay?

191
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,075
You,
say bye bye to daddy.

192
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,305
Bye bye, daddy.

193
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,637
Bell tolls.

194
00:15:23,662 --> 00:15:25,224
Yeah.

195
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:31,344
I love you

196
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:35,537

Behave.

198
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,400
- Ah, here you go.
- Thank you.

199
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,295
You've been haddled lately.
You've been busy nesting?

200
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,639
- Something like that.
- Mm, hmm.

201
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,600
Your idea of nesting being,
bullet-proofing the walls of the nursery?

202
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,740
Now, that is actually a great idea.

203
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:22,967
Yes.

204
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,724
I'll do it.

205
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,278
Well, that only took 2 weeks.

206
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:35,695
Uh-uh.
That's no small thing being a god-mother.

207
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,958
I mean,
i didn't take your asking lightly.

208
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:43,306
Oh, I know.
You think you can handle it?

209
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:49,015
Well, I'm competent, brilliant,
stunningly beautiful, and really fun, aren't I.

210
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,671
Really honored.

211
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:54,944

Today, I need your undivided best.

221
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,719
The most important people in
the world are in our care.

222
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,820
So muck in, and get it right.

223

- A bit early, aren't you?
- Nope.

230
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,599
- We're moving up our schedule.
- I see.

231
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,136
The fewer people know the president's
exact movements, the better.

232
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:27,513
- Why wasn't I told?
- Nobody was.

233
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,311
That's how you keep it a surprise.

234

Everything is going to be fine.

252
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,963
Important matters of state?

253
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:07,565
That was daughter number 2.

254
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,203
She didn't pass
her driving test.

255
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,414

I can't believe we're doing this...

264
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:06,015
... a private tour of westminster Abbey...

265
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,056

You know, the funny thing is,
James always hated funerals.

285
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:34,169
Yeah, don't we all.

286
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,954

We've been compromised.

295
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,939
Fuck.
They're not real cops!

296
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,709
Two in front!

297
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:57,125

What's going on?

303

Mr. president!

305
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,573
We have to evacuate.

00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,808
Oh, Jesus.

307
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,667

Almost there.

314
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,542
Move!

315
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:28,176
You okay sir?

316
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:30,405

Dean court.
Black Land Rover.

323
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:26,532
I don't believe it.
They overran everything.

324
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,244
Not everything.

325
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:42,313
Looking for hot extract.
Marine 1 for southpaw.

326
00:29:42,338 --> 00:29:44,588

00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:02,440
Let them drive next to us.

332
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:06,515
Hold him.

333
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,312

- Voight.
- Voight.

340
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:19,593
Keep pressure on the wound.

341
00:31:19,618 --> 00:31:22,126
- Voight!
- Voight! Voight!

342
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:25,549
- He's dead, Lynn.
- Oh god.

343
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:49,724
Get down, sir.

344
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:02,945
- Jacobs, take that wheel.
- Got it!

345
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:09,663
- Get in!
- Got it.

346
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,280
Mike, on your left!

347
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:27,093
Not really where you
want to be right now.

348
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:30,121
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

349
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:34,599
Fuck you.

350
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:43,851
We're almost there sir.

351
00:32:57,983 --> 00:32:59,361
Come on, let's go.

352
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:01,215
Go, sir, go.

353
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:22,344
5 world leaders are confirmed dead.
Along with hundreds of innocent civilians

354
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:28,289
in an attack that has decimated most of the
known landmarks in the British capital.

355
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:30,856
Sana'a
Yemen

356
00:33:48,578 --> 00:33:52,163
clarkson and Asher are alive.
All the rest are dead.

357
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:55,524
And I thought it was
too much to hope for.

358
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,990
We just changed the world.

359
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,660
Plan b, sultan.

360
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,375
Fate, has smiled on us.

361
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:37,227
Central London

362
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,989
lights out, London.

363
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:07,627
Generators will kick in.

364
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:09,330
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

365
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:13,074
We've asked the residents of London
to stay indoors for their own safekeeping,

366
00:35:13,075 --> 00:35:16,922
while the situation remains fluid.
Let there be no doubt,

367
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:21,013
that every relevant police authority
and counter-terrorism unit

368
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:24,660
is actively at work regaining
control of our streets.

369
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:28,423
- And within hours we will secure the city.
- Call Mike.

370
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:31,450
And those responsible,
would be swiftly brought to justice.

371
00:35:32,802 --> 00:35:35,029
Jesus, it's not connecting.

372
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:40,614
- How bad is it?
- It's pretty goddamn bad, sir.

373
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:42,574
All lines of communication
have been compromised,

374
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,416
- both civilian and military.
- Shit.

375
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:47,890
We've tasked satellites and drones
to get eyes on, but so far nothing.

376
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:52,299
Sir, the drone is on station.
We have visuals incoming.

377
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:54,412
Coming up.

378
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,611
Oh my god.

379
00:35:59,636 --> 00:36:01,932
Secretary of defense
Ruth MacMillan

380
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:03,524
deputy director NSA
ray Monroe

381
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:05,095
nearest quick reaction force?

382
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,545
- Sicily, two hours out.
- Speed them up.

383
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,289
And get a line to downing street,
and to box emergency command.

384
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:12,607
Yes, sir.

385
00:36:12,632 --> 00:36:14,500
Satellite is up.

386
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:16,857
Marine one is airborne.
Southpaw is evaced.

387
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:19,010
- Good lord.
- Yes!

388
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:21,666
Marine one with southpaw on board,
en route to stansted.

389
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:24,103
Prep air force one for urgent departure.
Copy.

390
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:27,273
Copy.
Air force one prepped and ready to go.

391
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,021
It was a trap.

392
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:41,444
That's an understatement.

393
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,298
Holy shit.

394
00:36:45,323 --> 00:36:48,088
It's one thing to plan for this.
Another to live it.

395
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:49,953
Alright, well, we're good now.

396
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:52,670
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah.

397
00:36:52,695 --> 00:36:55,791
We'll be on secure ground
in 10 minutes, okay?

398
00:36:57,275 --> 00:37:00,835
There was no chatter on this.
None.

399
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:02,544
Something of this magnitude,

400
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:04,977
it took years to plan
and we had days.

401
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:07,232
It's a fucking bloodbath.

402
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:10,311
How did they do this, Mike?

403
00:37:10,336 --> 00:37:12,978
They only have to
get it right once.

404
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:16,741
Today, they got it right
way more than that.

405
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:23,216
Oh fuck!

406
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,880
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday!

407
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:28,657
Marine three is down.

408
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,703
Oh no.

409
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:45,170
Roof-top, 3 o'clock,
you see him?

410
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:47,760
Marine two,
2 shooters at 3 o'clock.

411
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:49,185
Copy that.

412
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,132
- We're being pinged.
- Stingers.

413
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:55,379
Deploying flares.

414
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,825
Okay, stinger down.

415
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:14,358
- Stinger at 3 o'clock.
- Climb! Climb!

416
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:36,363
- Marine one, out of flares.
- Marine two, out of flares.

417
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:40,633
- Marine two, prepare for sacrifice.
- Copy.

418
00:38:48,885 --> 00:38:50,955
Marine two is down.

419
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,110
Missile lock on.

420
00:38:53,894 --> 00:38:56,685
Mr. president, we're going to take a hit.

421
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,707
Brace for impact.

422
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:25,625
Oh god.

423
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,176
Sir.

424
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:48,798
Sir, you good?
You okay?

425
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:52,097
Sit up.
Can you move?

426
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:54,330
Yeah.
Okay, sir.

427
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,347
- You with me?
- Yeah.

428
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:02,648
Lynn!
Lynn!

429
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:04,453
No.

430
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:08,569
- My god.
- Oh my god.

431
00:40:09,113 --> 00:40:10,909
Ben.
Ben.

432
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:19,552
Ben, get out of the chopper.
Ben, get out of the chopper.

433
00:40:19,577 --> 00:40:22,692
This thing could blow at any second.
Go.

434
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:33,499
I never thought you would outlive me.

435
00:40:36,256 --> 00:40:37,741
Me either.

436
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,117
Oh shit.

437
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,876
Do me a favor.

438
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:55,769
Stay alive.

439
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:58,742
You got to see your kid.

440
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:06,915
Make those fuckers pay.

441
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,973
I will.

442
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:40,741
Fox to command.
This is golf 1, you copy?

443
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:45,684
Fox to command.
This is golf 1, you copy?

444
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:48,238
Fuck.

445
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,814
Fuck.
Looks like we're walking.

446
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:03,064
Mr. president.
Those better be comfortable shoes.

447
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,698
Sir, I think you're going to
want to take a look at this.

448
00:42:35,723 --> 00:42:37,294
I'll put it up.

449
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:42,782
To our friends in the west,

450
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:48,186
whose idea of war
is a remote testing location.

451
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:53,368
Thousands of miles from the
comfort zone of your shopping malls,

452
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:57,987
who sent your porge to be blown
to bits in our land, or better yet.

453
00:42:58,012 --> 00:43:01,651
Murder our family remotely from the sky.

454
00:43:01,676 --> 00:43:04,745
Your time, is over.

455
00:43:04,746 --> 00:43:09,391
We're bringing the war to you.
Make no mistake.

456
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:14,199
This is the day,
when your world changes forever.

457
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,420
Jesus.

458
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:21,116
This is all over social media too.
Everybody in the world has seen this.

459
00:43:21,136 --> 00:43:23,815
Aamir barkawi.

460
00:43:23,816 --> 00:43:25,645
Number 6 on the 10 list.

461
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,915
This man is responsible for
more deaths than the plague.

462
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:31,665
Sells arms to every failed state
in the world.

463
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:37,203
Has a vast array of connections,
terrorists, mercenaries, corporations.

464
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:41,910
Mr. vice-president,
it's barkawi.

465
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:45,779
Put him through.

466
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:51,314
Thought you might take my call.

467
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:53,965
You understand if I make
it difficult to track.

468
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:56,711
You have me at somewhat of a loss.

469
00:43:56,736 --> 00:44:01,075
I thought you would've learned a lesson
by now, about crawling out of your hole.

470
00:44:01,076 --> 00:44:04,474
I've never lifted
a finger against you.

471
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:07,261
You arm those who have.

472
00:44:07,286 --> 00:44:13,131
I sold triggers, Mr. trumbull,
just like you.

473
00:44:13,156 --> 00:44:14,909
What do you want?

474
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:17,030
Your president.

475
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:20,442
You can end this right now.

476
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:25,691
- Just hand him over.
- That's not going to happen.

477
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:30,175
Then every death from this moment
forward will be on your hand.

478
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:46,575
Barkawi, sells arms
to dummy companies.

479
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,916
Some of them probably in London.

480
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:50,590
Find a connection to him.

481
00:44:50,615 --> 00:44:53,714
He's probably been
planning this for years.

482
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:55,439
Everybody makes a mistake.

483
00:44:55,464 --> 00:44:58,855
We have to find him before
he finds the president.

484
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:01,336
Let's get to it.

485
00:45:19,685 --> 00:45:22,145
- Mike, he's a policeman.
- Yeah?

486
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:25,835
Not exactly standard police issue.

487
00:45:28,443 --> 00:45:29,922
Really?

488
00:45:31,576 --> 00:45:33,299
Oh, my god.

489
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:39,420
- I've never seen a man suffocate before.
- I didn't have a knife.

490
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,213
He's got more ammunition
than the entire us army.

491
00:45:43,238 --> 00:45:45,151
How can they pull
something like this off.

492
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:46,777
There's got to be somebody
on the inside.

493
00:45:46,802 --> 00:45:49,161
Yeah, looks like it.

494
00:45:49,162 --> 00:45:51,667
These aren't you typical
spring pre-hillbillies.

495
00:45:51,692 --> 00:45:54,658
- These guys are pros.
- We should go for the embassy.

496
00:45:54,683 --> 00:45:56,810
Nah.
They'll be expecting that.

497
00:45:57,634 --> 00:46:01,055
There's a mi-6 safe house near here.
I have a contact there.

498
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:04,276
We go there, we wait it out,
and we get an extraction.

499
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:05,845
- Do you trust them?
- Yeah.

500
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:11,055
The fact is, every single one of these guys
is a terrorist asshole until proven otherwise.

501
00:46:11,056 --> 00:46:14,916
The only person you trust right now,
is me, okay?

502
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,132
Come on, let's go.

503
00:46:18,726 --> 00:46:20,790
We got to get underground.

504
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:24,011
These guys are everywhere.

505
00:46:42,071 --> 00:46:43,745
Let's go.

506
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:54,252
Just stay here.
I'll be back.

507
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,254
Raza.

508
00:47:56,894 --> 00:47:58,649
Raza.

509
00:48:02,322 --> 00:48:03,822
Here.

510
00:48:08,106 --> 00:48:10,625
Oh, we can do this,
it's really fun.

511
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:14,409
Raza.
Answer me, brother.

512
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:22,745
Raza's not feeling too well at the moment.
He's a little bit fucked up.

513
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,091
Hey, you.
What's this dick guy's name?

514
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:31,509
This is kamran.
Who is this?

515
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,370
Hey, Cameron.

516
00:48:33,406 --> 00:48:35,240
My name is Mike banning.

517
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:38,218
- You are the one with the president.
- Bingo.

518
00:48:38,243 --> 00:48:40,310
So why don't you boys pack
up your shit and head back

519
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:43,452
to fuckingninstan or wherever
it is you're from.

520
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,044
You should've let us
kill him quickly.

521
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:50,151
Because now, we're going
to kill him slowly.

522
00:48:50,176 --> 00:48:54,831
And stream it live.
For the whole world to see.

523
00:48:54,856 --> 00:48:57,401
Can you hear me, Mr. president?

524
00:48:58,142 --> 00:49:00,690
- Tell him.
- Yeah, he can hear you.

525
00:49:00,715 --> 00:49:03,668
Hey, here's something
i want you hear first.

526
00:49:14,437 --> 00:49:16,908
That's the sound of
your brother dying.

527
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:20,502
Yeah.
Not much of a talker, that one.

528
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:23,178
But I bet you,
one of your men will.

529
00:49:23,203 --> 00:49:25,782
I'll see you soon, Cameron.

530
00:49:29,202 --> 00:49:32,112
- Was that really necessary?
- No.

531
00:49:40,335 --> 00:49:42,481
The brits are compromised.

532
00:49:42,506 --> 00:49:46,315
Police for sure.
Who do you trust?

533
00:49:46,362 --> 00:49:49,451
We can also assume all communications
are compromised.

534
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:52,848
Anything that isn't secured,
could get into the wrong hands, sir.

535
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:57,227
- And banning would know that too.
- So how could he even reach out for help?

536
00:49:57,392 --> 00:50:00,657
There, freeze that.
Sir.

537
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:03,252
Is banning left-handed?

538
00:50:03,277 --> 00:50:04,857
No, right-handed.

539
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:08,804
Okay, well, the president doesn't move
without a drone or a satellite over his head.

540
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:11,870
- Banning knows that.
- It's his left hand.

541
00:50:11,895 --> 00:50:16,121
- Southpaw, six.
- Shorthand for mi-6.

542
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:19,931
Look for any mi-6 location
in that area.

543
00:50:19,932 --> 00:50:22,527
- Yes, sir.
- Alright, banning.

544
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:37,711
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

545
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:40,538
Made out of bourbon
and bad choices, huh?

546
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,537
Sit down, take deep breaths.

547
00:50:49,962 --> 00:50:51,981
How many you think died?

548
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:55,932
I don't know.
A lot.

549
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:58,522
All those innocent people.

550
00:50:58,547 --> 00:51:01,181
Dead,
because of me.

551
00:51:01,182 --> 00:51:03,742
No.
Not because of you, because of them.

552
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,701
They tried to kill you, sir.

553
00:51:05,702 --> 00:51:07,648
And they killed
all these people,

554
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,680
just to make everyone
else a little more afraid.

555
00:51:09,705 --> 00:51:12,291
Well, fuck that.
And fuck them.

556
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:14,029
Mike.

557
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:16,731
You don't let them take me.

558
00:51:16,732 --> 00:51:19,202
- I'm not going to.
- You need to do it.

559
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:21,706
If it comes to it.
If it's going south.

560
00:51:21,731 --> 00:51:23,267
-Sir.
-Mike.

561
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:27,949
If it comes to it,
i want you to kill me.

562
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:32,097
That's an order.

563
00:51:32,992 --> 00:51:35,034
I will not be executed for propaganda

564
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:37,031
as my son and
the American people see me

565
00:51:37,056 --> 00:51:39,727
on fucking YouTube
for the rest of their lives.

566
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:46,619
Okay.

567
00:51:54,492 --> 00:51:57,157
Vice president trumbull,
it's an honor, sir.

568
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:58,661
Chief inspector.

569
00:51:58,686 --> 00:52:00,887
I'm afraid our...
News isn't promising.

570
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:04,900
Our dearly departed prime minister
James Wilson was assassinated.

571
00:52:05,117 --> 00:52:06,805
Poison in his anesthesia,

572
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,326
and his doctor's body found
dumped about an hour ago.

573
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:11,202
State funeral.

574
00:52:11,227 --> 00:52:15,096
Must-attend event for western leaders.
Each one a target.

575
00:52:15,097 --> 00:52:18,046
Goddamn.
And we walked right into it.

576
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,826
And all dead.
By your men and ours.

577
00:52:20,827 --> 00:52:22,336
What's happening on the ground?

578
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:25,430
Well, the terrorists have
killed 19 first-responders.

579
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:28,406
With another 30 unaccounted for.

580
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:30,054
They're impersonating us.

581
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,466
Our people are walking
right into ambushes.

582
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:34,176
Say the word and we go in.

583
00:52:34,177 --> 00:52:36,078
But make no mistake.

584
00:52:36,103 --> 00:52:38,952
We risk turning London
into another fallujah.

585
00:52:38,977 --> 00:52:40,701
That's the last thing we need.

586
00:52:40,726 --> 00:52:42,866
The president in the
middle of an urban battle.

587
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:44,496
Or the citizens of London.

588
00:52:44,497 --> 00:52:47,204
Or you're just as likely to take out
half the metropolitan police force,

589
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:48,691
unless you can tell me
how you can tell the difference

590
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:50,982
between the good
guys and the bad guys.

591
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:53,313
We're going to have to
stand down our emergency services.

592
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:56,443
- Surrender London?
- He's right.

593
00:52:57,187 --> 00:52:59,719
Take out all legitimate personnel.

594
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:02,056
Anyone that remains
is a terrorist.

595
00:53:02,081 --> 00:53:03,452
Look, the sooner we end this,

596
00:53:03,477 --> 00:53:06,406
the more chance there is of stopping
London becoming a complete war zone.

597
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:09,394
Well, how do we get the
word out to our people?

598
00:53:09,992 --> 00:53:11,752
Air raid system.

599
00:53:11,777 --> 00:53:15,657
We sound that, people know to
stay secure in their place, then...

600
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:17,913
You let the military sweep in.

601
00:53:18,257 --> 00:53:20,496
Knock door-to-door, if necessary.

602
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,100
Clear these bastards out.

603
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,969
6:30 pm

604
00:54:04,984 --> 00:54:06,781
good evening.

605
00:54:06,806 --> 00:54:08,664
Is the auntie in?

606
00:54:22,351 --> 00:54:24,201
Put that away.

607
00:54:25,884 --> 00:54:29,120
- Are you who I think you are?
- Unfortunately.

608
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:33,762
Thanks.

609
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:43,600
What a pleasure this is, two handsome men
visiting me on such a lovely evening.

610
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:45,143
Long time, Jax.

611
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:48,522
Yeah, not long enough.
Mr. president.

612
00:54:48,547 --> 00:54:52,659
Sir,
jacquelin, mi-6 finest.

613
00:54:52,684 --> 00:54:54,867
- Don't fuck with her.
- Hello.

614
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,068
The phones are down.

615
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:09,092
That said, it did allow us
to pick up this.

616
00:55:10,657 --> 00:55:13,987
Mr. president, banning.

617
00:55:14,357 --> 00:55:16,965
I hope this finds you well.

618
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:20,162
Mike, we got your message.

619
00:55:20,757 --> 00:55:23,826
And I'm sure you don't know
who you can trust,

620
00:55:23,827 --> 00:55:27,076
and all prior authentications
may be compromised.

621
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,947
So, I offer you this,

622
00:55:30,117 --> 00:55:33,498
do you have any idea the joy
a man experiences

623
00:55:33,523 --> 00:55:35,828
pulling a 70 pound king mackerel

624
00:55:35,853 --> 00:55:38,678
- out of the waters around Jekyll island?
- Out of the waters around Jekyll island?

625
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:40,267
That's him.

626
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:44,761
A delta team has been
clandestinely inserted.

627
00:55:44,786 --> 00:55:47,656
By now, they should be
en route to your position.

628
00:55:47,686 --> 00:55:49,563
They'll take you to the us embassy,

629
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:53,952
where an armored convoy stands by
to get you out of Sam range.

630
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:56,947
- And on to a military train.
- Thank god.

631
00:55:57,097 --> 00:55:58,532
Let's get us out of here.

632
00:55:58,557 --> 00:56:00,748
Alright.
Sir, who's behind all this?

633
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,910
Aamir barkawi.

634
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:13,012
Barkawi provides armaments.
He's a fucking criminal.

635
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:15,121
Shielded by governments.

636
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:19,090
Mike, there was a drone
strike, to get him.

637
00:56:19,115 --> 00:56:22,624
2 years ago, authorized by the g8.
So we took a shot.

638
00:56:23,497 --> 00:56:25,417
He survived.

639
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:28,691
We didn't know his family was there.

640
00:56:28,716 --> 00:56:30,852
His daughter was killed.

641
00:56:30,877 --> 00:56:34,066
Well, he certainly got his revenge.

642
00:56:34,377 --> 00:56:35,602
Civilians?

643
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:38,446
Well, if they're not being
targeted specifically...

644
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:40,849
- Collateral damage?
- Yeah, quite a lot, I'm afraid.

645
00:56:40,874 --> 00:56:45,179
It's government targeted. No official support
from any countries barkawi show, but..

646
00:56:45,204 --> 00:56:47,285
Didn't have any problems
finding recruits, did he?

647
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:50,452
It's united nations with every fucking
blood on their hands.

648
00:56:51,427 --> 00:56:53,336
Who's on the inside?
There's got to be somebody.

649
00:56:53,361 --> 00:56:55,222
Yeah, you're right.

650
00:56:55,247 --> 00:56:58,136
They've infiltrated our cctv system.

651
00:56:58,161 --> 00:57:00,531
They might copied Internet
outside the network.

652
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:04,386
- Yeah, but who?
- I don't know.

653
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:07,903
Mike,
if you hadn't move our schedule up.

654
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:13,348
Here you go, sir.

655
00:57:13,373 --> 00:57:15,116
- Get this down in you.
- Thanks.

656
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,424
I don't know about you,
but I'm thirsty as fuck.

657
00:57:17,449 --> 00:57:18,821
Yeah.

658
00:57:30,236 --> 00:57:32,014
How're you doing?

659
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,403
I was thinking about my son.

660
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:39,427
He sends me these
jokes every day.

661
00:57:39,452 --> 00:57:42,600
It's kind of our,
our thing, you know.

662
00:57:43,277 --> 00:57:46,682
A little off-color.
His mother wouldn't approve, but...

663
00:57:46,707 --> 00:57:48,659
I tell you something, Mike.

664
00:57:48,684 --> 00:57:51,625
These little messages
i get from him everyday,

665
00:57:52,397 --> 00:57:55,047
they mean everything, you'll see.

666
00:57:57,297 --> 00:58:00,376
Most important thing,

667
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:04,103
never criticize,
always encourage.

668
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,896
You just want them to be passionate.
That's what I always tell my son.

669
00:58:07,897 --> 00:58:10,913
Find something you care about,
and care deeply.

670
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:16,075
That and the golden rule.
Treat others as you like to be treated.

671
00:58:16,757 --> 00:58:18,301
That's it?

672
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,122
Yeah, basically.

673
00:58:21,147 --> 00:58:23,420
What about all the other stuff.

674
00:58:24,147 --> 00:58:29,719
Sleeping, eating, electrical outlets,
diapers, stairs, and ...

675
00:58:29,744 --> 00:58:31,819
That stuff takes care of itself.

676
00:58:31,844 --> 00:58:34,419
- Really?
- No.

677
00:58:34,907 --> 00:58:36,779
You'll figure it out.

678
00:58:37,945 --> 00:58:39,989
I think your dates have arrived.

679
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:46,079
When did trumbull leave that message?

680
00:58:48,614 --> 00:58:50,820
6:13

681
00:58:51,044 --> 00:58:52,924
32 minutes.

682
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:56,047
No way they got here that fast.

683
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:59,037
- Where's the zoom in?
- Here.

684
00:59:04,472 --> 00:59:06,367
They're not sweating.

685
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,226
- Huh?
- That gear weighs 40 pounds.

686
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:12,381
They just stalked all the way from outside
the wire and not a drop of sweat?

687
00:59:12,406 --> 00:59:14,288
It's got to be them.

688
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,755
Now they're going around the back.

689
00:59:17,405 --> 00:59:20,029
This doesn't look like a rescue formation.

690
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:22,775
Please don't tell me
that's not our delta team.

691
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,450
They've intercepted trumbull's message.

692
00:59:26,201 --> 00:59:29,886
Jax,
where's the armory?

693
00:59:33,327 --> 00:59:34,763
Go.

694
00:59:36,234 --> 00:59:38,681
- You're not coming?
- They'll have this place surrounded.

695
00:59:38,706 --> 00:59:40,703
They catch us in the open,
we're done.

696
00:59:40,735 --> 00:59:43,395
They're not looking for you.
Go.

697
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,313
- Find the mole.
- Right.

698
00:59:45,338 --> 00:59:47,994
The wheels are in
the garage downstairs.

699
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:55,984
Alright.
Point this end towards the bad guy.

700
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,733
This is not good, Mike.

701
00:59:57,758 --> 00:59:59,856
Stay in here.
Stay down.

702
00:59:59,881 --> 01:00:02,104
And anybody but me
opens that door,

703
01:00:02,129 --> 01:00:05,609
- you empty that into him.
- What if you don't come back?

704
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:07,016
You're fucked.

705
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:09,905
- Mike.
- Don't jinx me.

706
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:13,337
That was inspiring.

707
01:02:15,236 --> 01:02:18,308
I was wondering when you're
going to come out of the closet.

708
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:21,541
That's not funny.

709
01:02:28,463 --> 01:02:30,604
We're almost out of this, sir.

710
01:02:32,004 --> 01:02:33,992
I'm a man of my own, am I?

711
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:35,719
Okay, let's go.

712
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:44,061
- God bless mi-6.
- I'll drive, you shoot.

713
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,891
What the fuck are you doing here?

714
01:03:03,206 --> 01:03:05,194
- We have a mole.
- I know.

715
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:06,761
Well, any ideas?

716
01:03:06,786 --> 01:03:10,743
Someone who likely has access to everything.
Routes. Security protocols.

717
01:03:10,882 --> 01:03:13,248
Emergency circuits.

718
01:03:13,344 --> 01:03:16,977
Jacquelin.
What brings you here?

719
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:21,196
7:30 pm

720
01:03:21,221 --> 01:03:24,329
- do we have the embassy covered?
- Affirmative, brother.

721
01:03:24,362 --> 01:03:28,470
Double the men, I want every
single man on that perimeter.

722
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,805
The car is bullet proof,
not politician proof.

723
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:38,851
Hey.

724
01:03:38,878 --> 01:03:40,892
The President of the United States
hasn't driven a car in 6 years.

725
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:42,387
- What do you want?
- Fuck.

726
01:03:42,412 --> 01:03:44,093
Take a left.

727
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,302
- Where're we going, Mike?
- The embassy.

728
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:48,650
The embassy.

729
01:03:48,675 --> 01:03:50,175
- You said they're expecting me.
- Yeah.

730
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,863
But, we're shit out of options.

731
01:03:56,603 --> 01:03:58,285
Here, take a right.

732
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,514
Mr. vice president, you wanted us
to find barkawi's mistake.

733
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:06,303
Take a look at this.

734
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:11,977
Of the 119 known barkawi front companies
he's used in the past,

735
01:04:12,002 --> 01:04:16,025
28 of them located in the uk,
11 in London proper.

736
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,473
- But, that's not news.
- But, it is a base line.

737
01:04:18,498 --> 01:04:20,658
Now, every entity he's
ever used in the past

738
01:04:20,683 --> 01:04:25,013
followed a very rough
communication pattern, except...

739
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:30,793
No known communication
in or out ever.

740
01:04:30,818 --> 01:04:34,238
That's under construction.
No one lives or works there.

741
01:04:34,248 --> 01:04:36,785
That's why this is
particularly interesting.

742
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,697
I had my NSA analysts take
a peek at the power usage.

743
01:04:39,698 --> 01:04:42,147
Through the roof
for the last 3 weeks.

744
01:04:42,148 --> 01:04:45,819
Pretty odd, considering nobody
lives or works there.

745
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:47,987
Central London.

746
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,762
Right under our bloody noses.

747
01:04:52,158 --> 01:04:54,903
Tell sas that we're going
to make a house call.

748
01:05:00,751 --> 01:05:02,296
Right.

749
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:06,054
It doesn't feel right.
Slow.

750
01:05:10,108 --> 01:05:11,627
Left.

751
01:05:15,062 --> 01:05:16,773
Okay, stop.

752
01:05:22,742 --> 01:05:24,353
This doesn't look good, Mike.

753
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:27,222
There's no way to
dress this up, sir.

754
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:30,404
- It isn't good.
- Could be worse.

755
01:05:31,411 --> 01:05:33,238
We could be walking.

756
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:37,198
Atta boy.
Don't stop for anyone.

757
01:05:50,726 --> 01:05:52,135
Fuck!

758
01:05:59,582 --> 01:06:01,899
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

759
01:06:03,416 --> 01:06:05,595
- We fucking made it.
- We did.

760
01:06:05,871 --> 01:06:07,451
We did.

761
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,985
Mike!

762
01:06:41,124 --> 01:06:43,091
Mike!

763
01:07:15,058 --> 01:07:16,958
Where is he?

764
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:23,702
Fuckers.

765
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:25,633
Where is he?

766
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:29,036
Broadwick and Lexington stop.

767
01:07:29,061 --> 01:07:30,801
Leave him.
Come on, back off.

768
01:07:30,826 --> 01:07:33,144
Take it easy, take it easy.

769
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,417
You got to be banning.

770
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,876
Will Davis,
captain, 22 sas.

771
01:07:39,901 --> 01:07:41,483
Trumbull sent us,
called jacquelin.

772
01:07:41,508 --> 01:07:44,003
President Asher has just been taken.

773
01:07:44,028 --> 01:07:47,427
And these assholes,
intend to publicly execute him.

774
01:07:47,428 --> 01:07:50,936
We know, at 8:00 pm.
It's all over the Internet.

775
01:07:51,508 --> 01:07:53,132
We'll take care of that.
Move out!

776
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:54,632
Hey, hey, wait.

777
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,380
Look, we can't let you
come with us, mate.

778
01:07:58,953 --> 01:08:01,665
How many times
you've saved this man's ass?

779
01:08:02,018 --> 01:08:03,375
Now, I'm going to go get him.

780
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,210
And you can either kill me,
or you can come with me.

781
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,291
I ain't going to go
any other way.

782
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,520
After you.

783
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,095
<font color="#53a9ff">Authorisation code disabled
cctv network connection
in progress</font>

784
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:35,721
cctv is back up.

785
01:08:35,746 --> 01:08:37,462
What did you do?

786
01:08:37,753 --> 01:08:41,744
Disable the authorization code
that shut down the cctv system.

787
01:08:43,971 --> 01:08:47,431
They've been watching us
using our own surveillance systems.

788
01:08:48,097 --> 01:08:51,737
Wait.
What authorization code?

789
01:08:52,883 --> 01:08:55,023
7:50 pm

790
01:09:13,136 --> 01:09:15,236
you should be thankful.

791
01:09:15,978 --> 01:09:20,693
How many men get to experience
their death witnessed by billions,

792
01:09:20,718 --> 01:09:22,103
... live.

793
01:09:22,128 --> 01:09:24,958
You are going to
go down in history.

794
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:28,551
I'm not the only one who's
going to die today, kamran.

795
01:09:46,114 --> 01:09:47,921
Box command.

796
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,140
Banning.

797
01:09:50,849 --> 01:09:54,677
Mike banning? Chief inspector hazard,
Scotland yard. Hold your position.

798
01:09:54,678 --> 01:09:56,997
Our military will be on
your location in 20 minutes.

799
01:09:57,022 --> 01:09:59,490
No sir. The president's
going to be dead in 10.

800
01:09:59,515 --> 01:10:00,817
You don't understand,

801
01:10:00,842 --> 01:10:03,020
we have NSA imagery of
where you're going.

802
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:04,893
It's their base of operations.

803
01:10:04,918 --> 01:10:07,327
There are nearly a 100 terrorists in there.

804
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:10,727
Yeah. Well, they should
have brought more men.

805
01:10:16,164 --> 01:10:19,618
- Things are going to get sporty.
- Just watch your balls.

806
01:10:19,643 --> 01:10:21,359
Will do.

807
01:11:04,872 --> 01:11:06,831
Rpg!

808
01:11:44,465 --> 01:11:47,072
2 o'clock clear!
Move up!

809
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,586
Okay.
Fuck that.

810
01:12:23,612 --> 01:12:25,385
It's fucking like trapped
in a storm blasting.

811
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,363
We can't storm that villa
with our force so small.

812
01:12:27,388 --> 01:12:30,847
Yeah, they kill the president
the second we try it.

813
01:12:30,872 --> 01:12:32,002
Alright.

814
01:12:32,027 --> 01:12:34,848
Call box command.
Make sure the utilities here

815
01:12:34,873 --> 01:12:38,923
- ... are isolated and switch off.
- You sounded like it's part of a plan.

816
01:12:38,948 --> 01:12:40,253
- See the generator?
- Yeah.

817
01:12:40,278 --> 01:12:43,399
- Let's poke out their eyes.
- Yeah. Generator, 12 o'clock.

818
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:51,246
- Fuck.
- What happened?

819
01:12:51,271 --> 01:12:52,836
The power supply was just cut.

820
01:12:52,861 --> 01:12:55,832
Get the emergency generators up.
Come on!

821
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,243
Mike.

822
01:13:00,268 --> 01:13:03,193
This is what we got.
This is a 3-story building.

823
01:13:03,218 --> 01:13:04,923
The entry point is here.

824
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:07,783
There are two stairwells.
One here, and one here.

825
01:13:07,808 --> 01:13:10,128
We believe the president is
being held in this room,

826
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:12,237
on the second floor.

827
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,202
Hold your position.

828
01:13:14,227 --> 01:13:16,357
I need you to hit this building
with everything you got.

829
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:19,584
- You got it.
- Keep them busy. I'll sneak in solo.

830
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:23,372
Take that.

831
01:13:23,397 --> 01:13:25,867
Do not touch that
button until I tell you.

832
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:28,311
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Yeah.

833
01:13:28,336 --> 01:13:30,077
Wish me luck.

834
01:13:31,938 --> 01:13:33,604
Don't shoot me.

835
01:14:50,323 --> 01:14:52,471
<font color="#a6ffa6">Flammable gas</font>

836
01:14:54,835 --> 01:14:57,105
7:55 pm

837
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,019
they're almost here.
Why don't you just kill him now?

838
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:34,361
No!
The whole world has to see this.

839
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:41,909
You hear that, kamran? That's
the sound of inevitability.

840
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:47,996
I'm going to kill you live.

841
01:15:48,021 --> 01:15:51,675
But that doesn't mean
you can't suffer privately first.

842
01:16:02,233 --> 01:16:04,061
Look at me!

843
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:12,612
I held my sister
as she died in my arms.

844
01:16:13,484 --> 01:16:16,752
We're all monsters, Mr. president.

845
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:22,807
It won't justify your insanity
to make you better about yourself.

846
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,236
Shoot him!

847
01:16:54,968 --> 01:16:56,991
7:57 pm

848
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:27,085
7:59 pm

849
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,313
almost.

850
01:17:31,338 --> 01:17:33,849
The power is back, we're
waiting for the Internet connection.

851
01:17:33,874 --> 01:17:34,945
Come on.
Come on.

852
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:39,502
Technology, only as good as
the dumbshits that are using it.

853
01:17:40,034 --> 01:17:43,240
- How long?
- Seconds.

854
01:17:44,433 --> 01:17:47,532
- We are live now.
- Okay.

855
01:17:55,673 --> 01:18:00,513
Say hello to the world,
Mr. president.

856
01:18:02,548 --> 01:18:05,260
8:00 pm

857
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,398
oh my god.

858
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:18,424
Any last words, Mr. president?

859
01:18:19,933 --> 01:18:22,503
I do solemnly swear,

860
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:27,012
that I will faithfully execute the office
of the President of the United States.

861
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:29,796
Son of a bitch.

862
01:18:31,223 --> 01:18:33,344
... the United States,

863
01:18:35,843 --> 01:18:42,826
and will to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect and defend...

864
01:18:56,697 --> 01:18:58,487
Oh my god.

865
01:19:18,305 --> 01:19:20,505
I'm not watching this.

866
01:20:08,573 --> 01:20:11,418
You know what
you guys don't get?

867
01:20:17,233 --> 01:20:21,397
We're not a fucking building.
We're not a fucking flag.

868
01:20:21,422 --> 01:20:23,762
We're not just one man!

869
01:20:23,763 --> 01:20:25,412
Assholes like you,

870
01:20:25,437 --> 01:20:28,230
have been trying to kill us
for a long fucking time.

871
01:20:28,262 --> 01:20:29,821
But you know what?

872
01:20:29,846 --> 01:20:32,136
A thousand years from now.

873
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:37,622
We'll still fucking be here.

874
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:44,719
Mike!
Grenade!

875
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:00,810
What took you so long?

876
01:21:00,835 --> 01:21:03,933
Sorry, I had a couple
of errands to run.

877
01:21:06,176 --> 01:21:09,868
Shit, does this fucker ever die?

878
01:21:16,433 --> 01:21:18,075
Alright, we got to go.

879
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,981
- You good?
- Let's get the hell out of here.

880
01:21:47,045 --> 01:21:49,415
Go!
Move, move, move...!

881
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,029
Mike!
Come on!

882
01:22:15,793 --> 01:22:17,603
Damn it.
I'm out.

883
01:22:25,184 --> 01:22:27,049
I'm out too.

884
01:22:28,759 --> 01:22:30,243
Come in!

885
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:32,542
- Davis.
- We're trapped!

886
01:22:32,567 --> 01:22:35,398
I repeat, we are trapped!

887
01:22:37,283 --> 01:22:38,552
- Blow it!

888
01:22:38,577 --> 01:22:41,297
Are you insane?
I can't blow it yet, you're not out.

889
01:22:41,322 --> 01:22:44,071
We're not gonna get out
unless you do!

890
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:46,406
Trust me!

891
01:22:46,431 --> 01:22:48,734
Now, god damn it!

892
01:23:01,073 --> 01:23:02,969
Go, go, go!

893
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,007
Banning.

894
01:23:54,032 --> 01:23:56,028
Banning, do you copy?

895
01:23:57,855 --> 01:24:01,485
- Has anyone found any sign of him?
- Nothing, over.

896
01:24:01,595 --> 01:24:02,591
Negative.

897
01:24:02,616 --> 01:24:05,146
Okay. Well, stay sharp.
Keep looking.

898
01:24:06,245 --> 01:24:07,879
Box command.

899
01:24:07,904 --> 01:24:10,216
No sign of the president yet.

900
01:24:36,193 --> 01:24:38,842
Box command,
we found them.

901
01:24:38,867 --> 01:24:40,843
The president is alive.

902
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:43,262
- Yay!
- Yeah!

903
01:24:56,253 --> 01:24:58,177
Have I ever tell you.

904
01:24:58,202 --> 01:25:00,743
I fucking hate funerals.

905
01:25:09,489 --> 01:25:11,498
- You okay?
- Yeah.

906
01:25:12,856 --> 01:25:15,973
Sir, I got you.

907
01:25:15,998 --> 01:25:17,744
Mr. president.

908
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,639
Funny.

909
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:24,698
Is that all they got?

910
01:25:24,723 --> 01:25:27,041
Yeah, it looks like it.

911
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:35,507
Lieutenant,

912
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:40,499
this could be the missing link,
to barkawi.

913
01:25:40,525 --> 01:25:42,949
I'll get it to
box command right away

914
01:25:43,586 --> 01:25:45,948
next time I tell you to blow it,

915
01:25:45,973 --> 01:25:47,780
just blow it.

916
01:25:50,533 --> 01:25:53,543
- Good job, lieutenant.
- You too, banning.

917
01:25:55,173 --> 01:25:57,049
Safe journey home.

918
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:59,237
If that's possible for you.

919
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,250
Next time, you want to leave town
after betraying your country,

920
01:26:34,275 --> 01:26:37,953
how about you steal a car,
to take you to your get away vehicle.

921
01:26:38,296 --> 01:26:42,296
Perhaps you want one without a GPS.
Because that just takes all the fun out of it.

922
01:26:47,133 --> 01:26:49,875
You forgot to delete you access logs.

923
01:26:50,299 --> 01:26:54,154
Your authorization code is there,
bright as day.

924
01:26:56,281 --> 01:26:59,592
The security cameras
showed you logging on.

925
01:27:05,203 --> 01:27:06,983
Get on the floor.

926
01:27:09,643 --> 01:27:12,033
Do I have to tell you,
this is the most dangerous time

927
01:27:12,058 --> 01:27:13,926
since the great war.

928
01:27:14,023 --> 01:27:17,543
We're cutting budgets while
the barbarians are at the gate.

929
01:27:18,753 --> 01:27:20,544
The system's failing us, Jax,
it's broken.

930
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,289
You know it as well as I do.

931
01:27:22,313 --> 01:27:23,818
Things have to change

932
01:27:23,843 --> 01:27:26,356
so you think
you teach us all a lesson?

933
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:31,051
That and 20 million Euros.

934
01:27:32,853 --> 01:27:34,689
Come with me, Jax.

935
01:27:36,087 --> 01:27:38,415
Get on the fucking floor.

936
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,197
Don't.

937
01:27:54,232 --> 01:27:57,192
Don't.
Get on the floor.

938
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:01,228
Get on the floor, John.

939
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,838
Get on the fucking floor!

940
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:26,059
Sir.
Your call phone.

941
01:28:31,237 --> 01:28:32,755
Kamran?

942
01:28:32,581 --> 01:28:37,760
Mr. barkawi.
I thought you'd take my call.

943
01:28:40,796 --> 01:28:45,546
You see this war,
this war which you started.

944
01:28:46,213 --> 01:28:48,359
You think it's over?

945
01:28:49,717 --> 01:28:52,336
I'm dedicating my
life to your deaths.

946
01:28:52,361 --> 01:28:55,121
This war will not end.

947
01:28:56,797 --> 01:28:59,506
Maybe you should look out your window.

948
01:29:19,807 --> 01:29:21,800
Clear to proceed

949
01:29:21,825 --> 01:29:26,006
ground asset confirmed.
Target clear of civilian persons.

950
01:29:50,097 --> 01:29:52,942
2 weeks after the devastating
attacks on the British capital,

951
01:29:52,967 --> 01:29:57,719
a new government has been installed,
and the city, has begun to rebuild.

952
01:29:57,744 --> 01:30:00,126
In the words of prime minister clarkson:

953
01:30:00,127 --> 01:30:06,772
"London may have fallen, but it has
always endured, and will rise again."

954
01:30:07,307 --> 01:30:10,911
So daddy is going to be
taking some more time off,

955
01:30:10,936 --> 01:30:12,622
isn't that cool?

956
01:30:12,647 --> 01:30:15,298
Yeah, maybe it's the new me.

957
01:30:15,323 --> 01:30:18,202
Or maybe the president insisted.

958
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:20,325
Yeah.

959
01:30:20,877 --> 01:30:23,282
He says he reckons I've
earned a few days off.

960
01:30:23,307 --> 01:30:25,561
Thanks to you, little one.

961
01:30:29,402 --> 01:30:31,541
It's okay, baby.

962
01:30:31,566 --> 01:30:33,253
It's okay.

963
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:36,040
It's okay.

964
01:30:41,564 --> 01:30:45,149
I wonder what you're going to
be passionate about with?

965
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,356
Yeah.

966
01:30:49,087 --> 01:30:51,721
Our hearts go out
to the people of London,

967
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:55,262
and to our friends around the world.

968
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:59,456
Far too many people died
for no good reason.

969
01:31:00,433 --> 01:31:04,137
There are those who will say that
this would never have happened

970
01:31:04,162 --> 01:31:07,566
if we would just
mind our own business.

971
01:31:07,591 --> 01:31:10,123
Nothing could be further from the truth.

972
01:31:10,336 --> 01:31:14,632
Frankly, we live in a dangerous
world and we have few good options.

973
01:31:14,657 --> 01:31:18,219
But the worst option,
is to do nothing.

974
01:31:18,746 --> 01:31:20,492
And finally,

975
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:23,828
we owe it to our children,
and to their children,

976
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:26,379
to engage in the world.

977
01:31:26,992 --> 01:31:29,110
God bless you all.

978
01:31:29,277 --> 01:31:33,025
And god bless the
United States of America.

979
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:35,768
That was vice president trumbull...
