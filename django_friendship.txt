Add the following at the top of your views.py:

from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from friendship.models import Friend, Follow


Getting Data about Friendships

-List all of a user's friends: Friend.objects.friends(request.user)
-List all unread friendship requests: Friend.objects.unread_requests(user=request.user)
-List all unrejected friendship requests: Friend.objects.unrejected_requests(user=request.user)
-Count of all unrejected friendship requests: Friend.objects.unrejected_request_count(user=request.user)
-List all rejected friendship requests: Friend.objects.rejected_requests(user=request.user)
-Count of all rejected friendship requests: Friend.objects.rejected_request_count(user=request.user)
-List of all sent friendship requests: Friend.objects.sent_requests(user=request.user)
-Test if two users are friends: Friend.objects.are_friends(request.user, other_user) == True


Getting Data about Follows

-List of a user's followers: Follow.objects.followers(request.user)
-List of who a user is following: Follow.objects.following(request.user)


Managing Friendships and Follows

-->Create a friendship request:

other_user = User.objects.get(pk=1)
Friend.objects.add_friend(
    request.user,                               # The sender
    other_user,                                 # The recipient
    message='Hi! I would like to add you')      # This message is optional

-->Let the user who received the request respond:

from friendship.models import FriendshipRequest

friend_request = FriendshipRequest.objects.get(pk=1)
friend_request.accept() or friend_request.reject()

-->To remove the friendship relationship between request.user and other_user, do the following:

Friend.objects.remove_friend(request.user, other_user)

-->Make request.user a follower of other_user:

Follow.objects.add_follower(request.user, other_user)

{% load friendshiptags %}
Then use any of the following:
